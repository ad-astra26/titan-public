# 2026-04-20: episodes 50 → 200 (give Titans a real chance at first win, per
# rFP_arc_training_fix.md iter-3). Drop --cycle (was inflating primary to
# ~94%/secondary ~3%/3% via 2-ep breaks — we now rotate at cron level). Timeout
# bumped 2700 → 4500 (75min). Expected wall time 200 ls20 eps × ~14s ≈ 47min;
# 75min timeout gives 60% safety margin. MAX_RETRIES dropped 1 → 0 because
# flock + timeout already bound things; a retry could push a run past the
# 90-min T2/T3 gap and flock-skip the next Titan's slot entirely.
#
# 2026-04-21: shared-host budget. T2/T3 share a 4-vCPU box; an active
# arc_competition.py + 2 running Titans pushed load avg to ~14, starving
# media-module heartbeats and triggering Guardian restart loops every 3 min.
# T1 keeps full 200 eps + 4500s (own VPS, no contention). Shared-host runs
# (T2/T3) get half: 100 eps + 2700s. Halves the sustained-CPU window per
# slot from ~47 min to ~24 min, well inside media's 180s heartbeat tolerance
# AND inside the 90-min cron gap to the other Titan's next slot.
