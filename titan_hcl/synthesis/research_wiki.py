"""research_wiki — DK.1: the sovereign LLM-Wiki research→declarative-concept seed.

RFP_synthesis_self_learning_meta_reasoning §7.D-knowledge (Phase D, Maker-locked
2026-06-12). Closes the *compounding* loop: a confirmed `acquired:research`
finding becomes a durable, anchored, **declarative `Engram` concept** — Titan's
own verifiable "wiki page" — so the next time the topic is asked he answers
`direct` from his own knowledge (DK.4) instead of re-researching it (no SOL).

WHY a dedicated continuous seed and NOT the dream `ConsolidationPass` clustering:
the dream pass only materializes a concept when ≥`min_cluster_size` cosine-near
siblings cluster (`consolidation._cluster_txs`), so a **solo** research finding
stays stranded as episodic, recalled weakly, re-researched later (the compounding
leak). DK.1 forms the concept **continuously at the EEL-A confirm event**
(INV-OML-12 — learning is continuous, not dream-gated), even solo.

THE SOVEREIGNTY GATE (GD10 / INV-OML-1 / INV-OML-10): the LLM is **librarian,
never author**. It only *names* the concept over the *already-verified* finding
(EEL-A confirmed research, the confirm-gate upstream in agno) — it never decides
whether the fact enters (the confirm did) and never supplies the fact's content.
`memory_type` is FORCED `declarative` (a research fact); `derivation_evidence` is
the finding's own anchored `tx_hash`, so a later wiki hit derefs to a real chain
record (INV-OML-10/11). A naming failure must NEVER drop verified knowledge — it
falls back to a deterministic name, the fact still persists.

This module is the PURE seed logic (no bus, no threads). The synthesis_worker
RESEARCH_CONCEPT_SEED handler drives it from a small daemon (the LLM name call
must run OFF the recv-loop AND OFF the writer thread — a blocking provider call
on the writer thread would freeze the heartbeat → the synthesis crash-loop). The
EngramStore writes are `@on_writer` and auto-route to the writer thread.

All spine writes route through `EngramStore`→`OuterMemoryWriter` (INV-Syn-7/19/28,
the single canonical write path); no parallel store, no markdown KB (the storage
ontology resolved substrate-native, RFP §7.D STORAGE ONTOLOGY block).
